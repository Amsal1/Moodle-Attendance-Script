# Moodle-Attendance-Script
My college uses Moodle CMS for its online educational platform so my friend suggested to make a script which could submit the attendence itself. Repository is licensed under GNU GPL v3.0 License.

# Requirements for Compiling
1. Download and Install [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_in/chrome)
2. Download and Install WebDriver for [Chrome](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)
3. Download and Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

# How-To
1. Edit and enter your username and password in script.py
2. Edit the Chrome webdriver path and save script.py
3. Execute python script.py
4. Enjoy :)

# Important
This program uses left navigation bar of ILI to traverse the subjects. 
It might be possible that some of the subject aren't visible to the left navigation bar so it won't be able to visit and mark attendence for those subject.
Example shown as below where I have CS301_A but it doesn't shows on my navigation panel.
